Proud to announce my contributions to the **Lithography Stepper v2.1** project at CMU Hacker Fab!

This open-source photolithography system enables DIY semiconductor fabrication with micron-level precision. My work focused on:

#### Key Contributions:
- **Mechanical Design**: Redesigned the optical mounting system for improved rigidity, reducing vibration from ~3Î¼m to **1.2Î¼m peak-to-peak**
- **Vibration Characterization**: Developed a quantitative testing protocol using high-speed imaging and ImageMagick processing
- **CAD Design**: Created custom adapter plates, motor mounts, and alignment fixtures in SolidWorks

#### Technical Achievements:
- Achieved **2 Î¼m feature resolution** on fabricated devices
- Rotated optical architecture to utilize high-precision X-Y axes
- Eliminated vacuum chuck dependency, simplifying the system

The stepper is now enabling students and makers to fabricate MOSFETs and basic integrated circuits outside traditional cleanroom facilities. All CAD files and documentation are open-source!
