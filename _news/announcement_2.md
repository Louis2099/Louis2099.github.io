Excited to announce that our paper **"Verifiable Safety Q-Filters via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and Multiplicative Q-Networks"** has been accepted for publication in IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)!

This work addresses a critical challenge in safe reinforcement learning: how to guarantee safety constraints while learning optimal control policies. Our approach combines:

- **Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis** for formal safety verification
- **Multiplicative Q-networks** for efficient policy learning
- **Real-time safety filtering** that can be deployed on robotic systems

The method provides provable safety guarantees while maintaining high performance in complex control tasks.

Many thanks to my co-authors Hanjiang Hu, Yujie Yang, and Prof. Changliu Liu for their collaboration on this project!
