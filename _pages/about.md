I'm a research assistant at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Changliu Liu](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/), I'm also working closely with Prof. [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/highlight-macvo-bestpaper/) and [Yorie Nakahira](https://www.cmu.edu/ece/learning-control/). Piror to that I completed my M.S(2025) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from CMU and B.S(2023) in ECE from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/). 
My research interests lies in the intersection of control theory and robot learning, and my goal is to acheive optimized performance and safety tradeoff for multitasking robot agents.


During the free time I work with [CMU HACKER FAB](https://hackerfab.ece.cmu.edu/), where we design automated semiconductor fabrication robots,
And I also like tennis üéæ, snowboarding üèÇ, and fishing üé£.
