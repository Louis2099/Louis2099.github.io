I'm a master student at Carnegie Mellon University Electrical and Computer Engineering, fortunately advised by Prof. [Changliu Liu](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/), I'm also working closely with Prof. [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/highlight-macvo-bestpaper/) and [Yorie Nakahira](https://www.cmu.edu/ece/learning-control/). My research interests lies in the intersection of robotics, control theory, and deep learning. 


During the free time I work with [CMU HACKER FAB](https://hackerfab.ece.cmu.edu/), where we design automated semiconductor fabrication robots,
And I also like scuba diving 🐠, snowboarding 🏂, and fishing 🎣.
